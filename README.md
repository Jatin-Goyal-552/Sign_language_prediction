# Sign_language_prediction

<h3> It is a small Deep Learning project to predict the sign language.</h3>
<h2>Dataset link :- https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist </h2>
<p>Note :- It can not predict sign of letter "J" and "Z" beacuse sign of these letter require motion. </p>
<p>My model is not so good in prediction, it is getting confused between sign of many letters. I trained another model on sign of "A", "E" ,"M" and "S" but it also did not help too much.</p>
<p>Make any sign in red box and  it will predict the character associated with that sign in sign language.</p>

<br>
<p>If I make the sign of 'A' then it will predict that it is "A". </p>

<p>Similarly it can predict any sign. </p>

<p>I am also using Python library named "spellchecker" to check the spelling of a particular word and if it is wrong then it will try to correct it.</p>
